Last updated: May 20, 2020

Welcome to Pleke (collectively, “Pleke”, “we”, “us”, or “our”). This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information that we receive through our website located at https://pleke.com/ (the “Site”) and our services accessible via our downloadable applications (“App”) (together, the “Services”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, protect, use and share information that identifies, relates to, or could be reasonably linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular identified or identifiable natural person or household (“Personal Information”).

By using or submitting information through the Services, you are indicating that you agree to be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites, services or applications, even if they are accessible through our Services. Also, please note that, unless we define a term in this Privacy Policy, all capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Use. So, please make sure that you have read and understand our Term of Use.

## Revisions to this Privacy Policy

Any information that is collected via our Services is covered by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected. We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we’ll notify you of those changes by posting them on the Services, and we’ll update the “Last Updated” date above to indicate when those changes will become effective.

## What personal data we collect and why we collect it

When you use the Services, we may collect Personal Information and other information from you as further described below.

#### Account Information

If you create a Pleke Account, we’ll collect certain information that can be used to identify you, such as your email address, which is Personal Information. In order to sync data between devices or restore data to a new device, we store all data you enter in Pleke, like accounts, categories and transactions to our servers.

#### Information Related to Use of the Services

Our servers automatically record certain information about how our users (each, a “User”) use our Services (we refer to this information as “Log Data”). Log Data may include information such as a User’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, the web page that a User was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on our Services that a User clicked on and other statistics. We use Log Data to administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) Log Data to improve, customize and enhance our Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our Users’ needs and preferences. We may use a person’s IP address to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how our Services are used.

#### Information Sent by Your Mobile Device

We collect certain information that your mobile device sends when you use our Services. For example, we may collect a device identifier, user settings and the operating system of your device, as well as information about your use of our Services.

## How We Use Information

Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide you a secure, smooth, and customized experience, to administer your use of the Services, and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate our Services. For example, we may use your information to verify your identity, allow you to register with Pleke, improve content in the App, provide notices, communicate with you via text message or email, monitor against fraud, or provide customer support at your request.

If you visit our login page, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser.

## Information that We Share with Third Parties

We will not share any User Information that we have collected from or regarding you except as described below.

#### Information Shared with Our Services Providers

We may engage third-party services providers to work with us to administer and provide the Services. These third-party services providers have access to your Personal Information and Financial Information only for the purpose of performing services on our behalf.

#### Information Shared with our Marketing Partners

We will never share your Financial Information or Account Information with our marketing partners. Our marketing partners will have information about your device and communicate with their servers to download marketing information and track clicks on the marketing information to show more details.

#### Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions

Information that we collect from our users, including Personal Information, is considered to be a business asset. Thus, if we are acquired by a third party as a result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition or asset sale or if our assets are acquired by a third party in the event we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, some or all of our assets, including your Personal Information, may be disclosed or transferred to a third party acquirer in connection with the transaction.

#### Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others

We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate:

- to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas);
- to protect our property, rights and safety and the property, rights and safety of a third party or the public in general; and
- to stop any activity that we consider illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.

## Modifying Your Information

You can access and modify the Personal Information associated with your Pleke Account, including your name, address and Bank Account details, through your Pleke Account settings in the App. If you want us to delete your Personal Information and your Pleke Account, please contact us via email at support@pleke.com with your request. You may delete the User Information associated with your Pleke Account by deactivating your account in the App. We’ll take steps to delete your information as soon we can from our servers, but some information may remain in archived/backup copies for our records, with third parties to whom it has been passed as permitted by this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by law.

## The Security of Your Information

We take reasonable administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect the information that we collect from or about you (including your Personal Information) from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When you enter sensitive information on our forms, we encrypt this data using SSL or other technologies. Please be aware, however, that no method of transmitting information over the Internet or storing information is completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information.

## Links to Other Sites

Our Services may contain links to websites and services that are owned or operated by third parties (each, a “Third-party Service”). Any information that you provide on or to a Third-party Service or that is collected by a Third-party Service is provided directly to the owner or operator of the Third-party Service and is subject to the owner’s or operator’s privacy policy. We’re not responsible for the content, privacy or security practices and policies of any Third-party Service. To protect your information we recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies of all Third-party Services that you access.

## International Transfer

Your Personal Information may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you’re located outside the United States and choose to provide your Personal Information to us, we may transfer your Personal Information to the United States and process it there.

## Our Policy Toward Minors

Our Services are not directed to minors under 16 and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from minors under 16. If we learn that we have collected Personal Information of a minor under 16 we will take steps to delete such information from our files as soon as possible.
